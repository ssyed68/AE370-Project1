# AE370-Project1
A Python-based data analytics project encompassing data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization, presented with Jupyter Notebooks and a detailed LaTeX report

## Project Overview

**AE370 Project** is a comprehensive data analytics initiative implemented in Python. This project focuses on:
- **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Automating the cleaning and transformation of raw datasets.
- **Analysis & Clustering:** Utilizing algorithms (like K-Means) to uncover hidden patterns and clusters in the data.
- **Visualization:** Generating clear and insightful plots to communicate the results.
- **Documentation:** A complete technical report is provided in LaTeX, which details the methodology, challenges, and outcomes.

This repository is designed for both research and practical applications, making it a robust reference for data-driven projects.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Preprocessing:** Efficient handling of missing data, type conversions, and normalization.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Clean separation of data processing, analysis, and visualization routines.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Implementation of clustering algorithms to identify data groupings.
- **Comprehensive Visualization:** Use of Matplotlib for static data representation.
- **Reproducible Experiments:** Jupyter Notebooks to document experiments and code evolution.
- **Detailed Documentation:** A technical report in LaTeX that describes the project in depth.
